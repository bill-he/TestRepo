/**
 * This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon S3 using the
 * AWS SDK for Java.
 * <p>
 * <b>Prerequisites:</b> You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer
 * account, and be signed up to use Amazon S3. For more information on Amazon
 * S3, see http://aws.amazon.com/s3.
 * <p>
 * Fill in your AWS access credentials in the provided credentials file
 * template, and be sure to move the file to the default location
 * (/Users/billhe/.aws/credentials) where the sample code will load the credentials from.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> To avoid accidental leakage of your credentials, DO NOT keep
 * the credentials file in your source directory.
